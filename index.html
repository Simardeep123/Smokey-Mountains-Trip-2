            <p class="text-left text-muted">The Great Smoky Mountains (Cherokee: ᎡᏆ ᏚᏧᏍᏚ ᏙᏓᎸ) are a mountain range rising along the Tennessee–North Carolina border in the southeastern United States. They are a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains, and form part of the Blue Ridge Physiographic Province. The range is sometimes called the Smoky Mountains and the name is commonly shortened to the Smokies. The Great Smokies are best known as the home of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which protects most of the range. The park was established in 1934, and, with over 11 million visits per year, it is the most visited national park in the United States.[1]

The Great Smokies are part of an International Biosphere Reserve. The range is home to an estimated 187,000 acres (76,000 ha) of old growth forest, constituting the largest such stand east of the Mississippi River.[2][3] The cove hardwood forests in the range's lower elevations are among the most diverse ecosystems in North America, and the Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest that coats the range's upper elevations is the largest of its kind.[4] The Great Smokies are also home to the densest black bear population in the Eastern United States and the most diverse salamander population outside of the tropics.[5]

            <p class="text-left text-muted">Gatlinburg is a mountain resort city in Sevier County, Tennessee, United States. It is located 39 miles (63 km) southeast of Knoxville and had a population of 3,944 at the 2010 Census[7] and an estimated U.S. Census population of 4,144 in 2018.[8] It is a popular vacation resort, as it rests on the border of Great Smoky Mountains National Park along U.S. Route 441, which connects to Cherokee, North Carolina, on the southeast side of the national park. Prior to incorporation, the town was known as White Oak Flats, or just simply White Oak.</p>

            <h4><kbd>My Cabin at Gatlinburg.</kbd></h4>
            <hr>
            <h5 class="text-left text-capitalize text-success">Tired of seeing more of the same, every day? Could you use a new view, or perhaps just a shift in perspective? Set in the very heart of purple mountains’ majesty, A Majestic View 1843 is the perfect vacation destination for you. Bring along your family or a group of close friends to this 2-bedroom, 2.5-bath retreat that sleeps 4. Allow the atmosphere to enchant you and truly refresh your view.

Inside this chalet, you’ll breathe deep and long as the gorgeous decor fills your view. You might be in the Smoky Mountains, but you won’t feel like you’re in just another mountain cabin once you step through the door. Modern furnishings, modern decor, and yes, all the modern conveniences make this space brilliant and inviting. Once you’ve taken it all in, you’ll step out onto one of the two decks and gaze in awe at the stunning views for which the cabin is named.

From your perch high on the mountain, you will have a bird’s eye view of the Great Smokies sitting in the distance, the city of Gatlinburg bustling below, and the tram regularly transporting visitors to and from Ober Gatlinburg. Watching the city move will be a unique preview into every part of your stay.

With the gorgeous views inside and the breathtaking views outside, you might be content to kick back and watch life happen from the comfort of your home away from home. However, if you long to sink your hands deep into the fun instead of just passively observing, having it all within viewing distance will make this an easy opportunity.</p>
